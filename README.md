# Geelong Tech Talk

Hi there! Thanks for dropping by! We're the Geelong Tech Talk group, and we're a primarily online meetup group aimed at bringing Geelong's tech community closer together. The pandemic has eroded community connections - many of us are primarily WFH, others have caring commitments - and getting to meetups is tough.

So, we're bringing you a monthly Geelong Tech Talk - 3 x 5 minute presentations and 15 minutes to mingle - over lunchtime. Grab a sandwich, learn something bite-size, and make, or renew, connections.

We're a broad group, and if you like:

* web dev in any flavour
* UX or design in any flavour
* infrastructure or devops in any flavour
* programming or development in any flavour
* hardware in any flavour
* machine learning, data analytics or related flavours

then you might like to join us!

You can email us at [geelongtechtalk@protonmail.me](mailto:geelongtechtalk@protonmail.me?Subject='Enquiry from the Geelong Tech Talk website') if you have any questions.

We're deliberately not using Meetup because it costs $$ and we figure that word of mouth

## Next online meetup:

TBA
